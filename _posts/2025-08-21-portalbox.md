The Portalbox is an open-source makerspace management project. It originated at Bucknell University and intends to spread worldwide, allowing makerspaces to control their
equipment and their users as they see fit. The Portalbox focuses on using interlocks to control power to equipment, such as 3D printers or laser cutters, based on the RFID
cards that each student possesses. I had the honor to work on v5 of the Portalbox over the summer of 2025.

Our team consisted of myself, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiden-cherniske/">Aiden Cherniske</a>, a Computer Engineering major in the Class of 2027,
and our makerspace director Matt Lamparter (**mlampart@bucknell.edu**) overseeing.
